## Current Status
This is an alpha version. 

Most of the library is quite well tested since many students have used it to complete the [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai) course. However it hasn't been widely used yet outside of the course, so you may find some missing features or rough edges. 

If you're interested in using the library in your own projects, we're happy to help support any bug fixes or feature additions you need&mdash;please use [http://forums.fast.ai](http://forums.fast.ai) to discuss.
